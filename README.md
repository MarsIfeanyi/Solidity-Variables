# Simple Contract with Variable Get and Set Functions

This GitHub repository contains a simple smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for creating Ethereum-based smart contracts. The contract includes four different types of variables and provides get and set functions for each of these variables. Additionally, each set function returns the value of the variable being modified, making it easy to verify the changes made.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract in this repository is designed to demonstrate the basic principles of variable declaration, modification, and retrieval in Ethereum smart contracts. The contract includes the following types of variables:

- Unsigned Integer (uint256): A 256-bit unsigned integer variable.
- Boolean (bool): A boolean variable representing a true or false value.
- String (string): A string variable to store text data.
- Address
